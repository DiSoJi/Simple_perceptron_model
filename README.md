# Simple Perceptron Model
A simple perceptron model for academic purposes.
If you are on the need of a crash course for a perceptron model for any reason whatsoever, this repository is for you!
Each file contains enough comments to understand all that's going on. Further academic reading is required if you want to understand the why's.

I hope to add more content to this repository if time allows, in the future!
